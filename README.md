## Verifying Binaries

To enhance security measures, we strongly advise verifying binaries prior to execution. Each release includes a manifest file containing the SHA-256 hashes corresponding to each released binary. In order to guarantee the authenticity of your downloads, it is imperative to ensure that the manifest file is signed by support@excc.co, and that the binary's hash aligns with the manifest.

Comprehensive guidance is accessible within the ExchangeCoin Documentation: [Verifying Binaries](https://docs.excc.co/advanced/verifying-binaries/). We encourage new users to begin with this resource.

The Public PGP Key from ExchangeCoin Team can be found on the main [website](https://excc.co/gpg.txt).

For users who have previously performed this process and retained the ExchangeCoin Release keys on their GnuPG keyring, the subsequent condensed instructions serve as a convenient refresher:

1. Download:

    * The zip/tarball for your specific OS / architecture
    * The file manifest and hashes, ending in `-manifest.txt`
    * The signature for the manifest, ending in `-manifest.txt.asc`

2. Verify that the manifest was directly signed by the ExchangeCoin project:

   ```
   $ gpg --verify <your manifest.txt.asc file>
   ```

   Example output:
   ```
   gpg: Signature made Wed 19 Apr 2023 09:19:22 AM CEST
   gpg: using RSA key 9DD10FAFB2A53E14BEF1B10D9AEB846958227764
   gpg: Good signature from "ExchangeCoin Team (The Official ExchangeCoin Team PGP Key) <support@excc.co>" [ultimate]
   ```

   If you see `Good signature from "ExchangeCoin Team (The Official ExchangeCoin Team PGP Key) <support@excc.co>`, then you're successful! You can trust that the `manifest.txt` came directly from the
   ExchangeCoin project.

3. Verify that the hash of your downloaded zip/tarball matches the manifest hash:

    * Windows:

        * If you have [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org/) installed, simply open up Windows
          Explorer, right click on the file, mouseover `CRC SHA`, then click `SHA-256`.

        * `$ certutil -hashfile <your file> SHA256`

    * macOS

        * `$ shasum -a 256 <your file>`

    * Linux

        * `$ sha256sum <your file>`

   Example output:
   ```
   7a65be7284486710d7f49f4c5f01381c876eac8686ce324efbe173b165e99bcb  exilibrium-linux-x86_64.AppImage
   ```

If the output hash aligns with the hash present in the manifest, the verification process is complete. You can now trust that the binary for your platform has been generated by the ExchangeCoin Team, and it is secure to proceed with software installation.
